Saving Results

# How do the resulting links differ from the other links... I think all the links with p&q are for the actual results.

  1. Job title - Title seems to be amongst all those \t and \n (DONE)

  2. Company name - Seems to be in that Mechanize::Page::Link

  3. Link to posting on Dice - Link is under title amongst all those \t's and \n's

  4. Location - I can see it in the link

  5. Posting date (not a relative date like "x weeks ago" because that will quickly be meaningless)

  6. Company ID - you can get from the ending of the link on the company name from results.

  7. Job ID
